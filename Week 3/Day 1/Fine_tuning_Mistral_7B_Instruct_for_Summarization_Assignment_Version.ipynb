Exploiting the fact that our weights are normally distributed and that we scale them to be in the range [-1, 1], this lets use use our NF4 datatype to roughly optimally express our high precision weights in a low precision format. While we still do need *some* higher precision numbers - this process lets use represent many numbers in low precision for the cost of 1 number in high precision.\n",
